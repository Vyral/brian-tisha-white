A home warranty is a great thing to have as protection whether you’re a buyer or seller. The answer to whether or not you need one changes depending on who you are.

**If you’re a homebuyer, you definitely want a home warranty.** Although you’ve probably had an inspection, there could be future issues that didn’t show up on the report. When there’s a spot in the contract where the buyer can negotiate for the seller to buy them a home warranty. **It helps protect you and probably won’t cost you anything.**

On the seller’s side, we also recommend that they always include a home warranty as liability protection. After you've sold a home, you really don’t know what’s going to happen. **If something major breaks in the next few months, a home warranty will cover any expensive repairs and provide peace of mind to any buyer out there.**
