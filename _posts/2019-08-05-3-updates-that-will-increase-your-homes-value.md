If you’re looking to increase your home’s value before putting it on the market, here are three updates you should focus on:

**1\. Kitchen updates.** You don’t necessarily have to tear out your cabinets, but there are several minor things you can do that will make a big difference, including adding new appliances, repainting, and/or updating the backsplash.&nbsp;

**2\. Bathroom updates (especially the master bathroom).** As with the kitchen, when we say “updates” here, we don’t mean everything has to be ripped out. Repainting, adding new vanity tops, installing new light fixtures, and replacing your shower door are all great updates that will make a big impact.&nbsp;

**3\. Curb appeal updates.** Studies show that most buyers make a buying decision within 90 seconds of pulling up to a house, so don’t underestimate the impact of your home’s curb appeal. Make sure the grass is green and well-kept, and consider adding some flowers and fresh mulch to the landscaping. Also, sweep off and clean the entryway so everything looks and feels fresh.&nbsp;

Now that you know what to do to boost your home’s value, be on the lookout for our next video where we talk about what not to do to your home before putting it on the market.&nbsp;
