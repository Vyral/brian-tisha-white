<center><em>Buying or selling a home is a big decision. Here&rsquo;s some advice to help make your decision easier.</em></center>

&nbsp;

One of the most common questions we hear is, “When is the right time to buy or sell a home?” **Truthfully, there is no simple, universal answer to this question.&nbsp;**

For buyers, the reality is that mortgage rates jump around all the time. Right now, they’re low, which is good. **If you can buy when interest rates are low, you can afford more house with the same payment.**

The statistics in the market also show us when more houses sell than others. Although we do business in many areas across North Texas, it’s important to understand that real estate is hyperlocal. **The national or state numbers don’t matter as much to you, but your neighborhood statistics really do.** If you need six months but in your neighborhood, things take three months to sell, you need to start preparing now.

**The real answer to this question lies within you.** What are your personal circumstances? Certain life situations necessitate a move more than others.

If you’re unsure about what your situation is or whether or not you’re ready to move, we’d love to consult with you and show you the path to get what you want out of your home sale or purchase.

**As for the question of, “When is the best time to invest in real estate?”, the answer is always.** We’ve been helping a lot of investors lately and we love helping people build wealth through real estate.

If you have any questions for us in the meantime or want our help with buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
