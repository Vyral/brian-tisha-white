We meet sellers all the time who want to know the best ways to sell quickly and for top dollar. There are actually six things sellers should focus on to do so, so don’t forget to implement these critical steps when the time comes for you to list:&nbsp;

**1\. Focus on staging.** The way you live in your house is different from the way you sell your house. While your home is on the market, it should look neat, tidy, and well-staged at all times.&nbsp;

<br>**2\. Spruce up your curb appeal.** What buyers see when they first pull up next to your home on the street will serve as their first in-person impression, so make sure it leaves a good one. Keep sidewalks and driveways clean and clear, and make sure your landscaping is presentable. A little bit of fresh mulch can go a long way.&nbsp;

<br>**3\. Highlight your home’s smart tech.** Today’s buyers love efficiency, and that’s exactly what smart tech provides. If your home has a smart thermometer or any other similar features, remember to position these items as a selling point during your listing process.&nbsp;

<br>**4\. Get rid of unpleasant odors.** After living in a home for an extended time, it’s easy to become noseblind to the smells that lurk within your walls. If you have pets or a smoker, it’s important to neutralize and eliminate any associated odors. With that said, it’s also crucial not to overdo it. Don’t overload the air in your home with super-strong perfume or a dozen, differently scented candles. Even pleasant smells can become overwhelming when used in excess.&nbsp;

<br>**5\. Update the lighting, hardware, and fixtures.** The truth about updating your home before you list is that bigger projects aren’t always better. Sellers will often get the most bang for their buck by focusing on small, yet important, details. Swapping out an old, worse-for-wear doorknob or a lighting fixture that’s straight out of the 90s will help put more money in your pocket at closing.&nbsp;

<br>**6\. Minimize your decor.** It’s easy to become overzealous with the design elements in your home. When it comes time to list, however, much of the staging process involves undecorating, not just redecorating. Keep design choices simple and neutral to appeal to the most buyers possible.
