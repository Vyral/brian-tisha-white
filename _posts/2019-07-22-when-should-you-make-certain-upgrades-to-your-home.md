Homeowners are often told that they need to upgrade their home right before they go on the market, but there are some guidelines to follow to make sure you get the best ROI for every dollar you spend on the property.

The factor that we’ll discuss today is your home-selling timeline. This is very important—how long from now do you intend to sell?

**If you’re five years away from selling your home**, it’s a good idea to upgrade your home’s big-ticket items, like your HVAC system, garage doors, your water heaters, and so on. These items won’t necessarily impact how much money you’ll get for the home, but they do impact your home’s saleability.

**If you plan to sell two years from now**, you’re probably getting more serious about the prospect of selling. Take this time to renovate areas like your kitchen and bathrooms. There are a lot of design trends for kitchens and bathrooms, so you still have time to hit the start of a certain trend so your home isn’t outdated by the time you’re ready to put it on the market. You’ll also get to enjoy these renovated areas yourself for a while before you move on to your next home.

**Now, if you’re planning to sell your home in a year or sooner**, it’s getting to be crunch-time. This is the time to start cleaning your home out, decluttering, touching up your paint, and repairing/replacing your flooring. Refreshing your home’s paint this close to the sale of your home means that it will look and smell fresh for potential buyers.
