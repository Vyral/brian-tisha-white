With regards to mortgages, we’re often asked about how long pre-approvals last. This is important to know: If you’ve been looking at homes for a while, you don’t want to be caught off guard and discover that your pre-approval has expired.

**Typically, a pre-approval lasts about 90 days, but this can vary depending on your market and your lender.&nbsp;**

A pre-approval is key to a home purchase. It lets both you and the seller know what you can afford, and it shows that you’re qualified to make a purchase up to a certain value.&nbsp;

You can get either a pre-approval or a pre-qualification from your lender, but it’s better to get a pre-approval. **To do so, you need to apply for the loan and provide some documentation, including income taxes, W-2s, employment history, debts, assets, and much more.** Keep in mind that recent, expensive purchases can affect the process.&nbsp;

After they look over this, they can give you a pre-approval that states how much of a mortgage you can qualify for. You can give this to your Realtor so they’re able to better help you find and make offers on homes.&nbsp;
