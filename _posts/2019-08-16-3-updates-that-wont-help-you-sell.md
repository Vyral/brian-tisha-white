When you’re updating a home, there are certainly some areas where you can get a terrific bang for your buck, but there are others where you won’t. Today we’re going to focus on those things that will not help you get your money back when it’s time to sell your home. Here are three improvements that you should avoid to maximize your resale value:

**1\. Solar panels.&nbsp;**We get it—they’re really cool. You’ll save money on your electrical bill and it’s good for the environment, too. However, you’ll have to spend a lot of money up front on one of these systems and you won’t get it back on your resale if you put the home on the market anytime soon.

**2\. New roof or HVAC.** These are both great things to have and can help your home sell faster, but the problem is that most buyers expect homes to have functioning roofs and HVACs so it doesn’t really add any extra value to what’s already there.

**3\. Swimming pool.** A swimming pool will certainly add value to your home, but you won’t get nearly as much back for it when you decide to sell. Be thoughtful about the addition of a pool, including how much you’ll spend on it and how much enjoyment you can get out of it before you do sell.

These three items won’t help you get more money, but they certainly won’t hurt your home’s ability to sell.
