  A lot of homebuyers are under the impression that a buyer’s agent isn’t
  necessary when buying a home. While that’s technically true, not having
  representation in your home purchase can make you extremely vulnerable.

We’re here today to answer a few of the most common questions we hear when it comes to the topic of home buying and working with agents. Without further ado, let’s get to them:

**Can homebuyers contact the listing agent directly?**

Technically, yes. The only person that might frown on a homebuyer contacting a listing agent directly is a buyer’s agent, who works for a buyer directly. I think a better question might be “Is it in a buyer’s best interest to contact the listing agent directly or should they get their own agent?” We’ll cover this question a little later.

**Do buyers need to sign an agreement to view a property?**

No, there is no documentation required. However, there are a variety of situations where it might be in the buyer’s best interest to sign an agreement with a buyer’s agent because if you don’t sign anything, you technically aren’t a client. In Texas, the laws are written to protect sellers. Unless a buyer signs a contract with a buyer’s agent, all agents in Texas are working for a seller.

**Do buyers need to find their own agent to see a property?**

There are a variety of ways you can see a property. Of course, you can contact the listing agent as we mentioned before, but many homes have open houses on the weekends and it’s a great, low-pressure way to check out several homes in a certain area. In our opinion, it’s smart for buyers to seek out their own agents to answer any questions they might have and help them through the process.

**When do buyers need their own agents?**

It’s best to start working with one early on in the process. A great agent will be able to help you all along the way. We have relationships with inspectors, mortgage lenders, and other professionals that we trust to help move the transaction along and keep you protected.
