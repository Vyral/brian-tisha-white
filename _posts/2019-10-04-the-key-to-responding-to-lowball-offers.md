<center>Has your client received a lowball offer? If so, here&rsquo;s how you should react.</center>

&nbsp;

As an agent, what steps should you take after receiving a lowball offer?&nbsp;

**The first thing to note is that there’s nothing you can do to prevent such offers.** You should make sure the home isn’t overpriced, but even a listing that’s right at market value will receive offers that are lower than you’d prefer.&nbsp;

These things just happen, and as frustrating as they can be, it’s important to focus on the positives. You and your client should be happy you got an offer to begin with, even if it’s lower than you’re willing to accept.

**You may find yourself tempted to get offended on behalf of your client, but you must resist this urge.** Your client might not see a low-ball offer the same way you do. They might think it’s a fairly decent deal. Of course, you must advocate on their behalf and try to get them the best possible results from their home sale, but don’t allow your emotions to override your professional duty.&nbsp;

If you stay calm, price your client’s listing fairly, and approach lowball offers with a willingness to negotiate, you will likely find yourself with a better deal on the table in no time.&nbsp;
