People always ask us to explain the reason behind our real estate group’s name: BlueFuse.

The truth is simple—we wanted to choose a name that would be as iconic and memorable as our service. **We wanted to choose a name that would be just as unique as the experience we provide our clients.**

The name also represents the skills and ideas we each bring to the table. Tisha is a design guru. She’s got a great eye for color, among other things, and loves to implement shades of blue in her work.

As for myself, I’ve got a lot of experience in the business side of things, given that I worked in corporate sales for 20 years. The combination of our two skill sets is how BlueFuse was born. **We *fused* our abilities to form one great brand.**

At BlueFuse, we make real estate easy for you.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
