When was the best time to buy a home? **The answer: probably a couple years ago.** Home prices have gone up dramatically over the past couple of years. Rates and prices were relatively low, and for folks who owned a home, there was a great opportunity.

Historically speaking, however, **now is still a great time to buy.** Rates have ticked up a little bit, but we can remember a time when people were buying homes at 12% or 13% rates.

**It’s also still a terrific market for sellers.** We’ve been in a crazy seller’s market for the last two years, and that’s starting to shift.

To us, this shift is a good thing; the market was frenzied, and those who wanted to move often couldn’t because they couldn’t get the house that they wanted. Now, things have slowed down, allowing people to get the home they’ve always wanted.

But just because buyers are getting more opportunities to purchase, it doesn’t mean that sellers won’t still get great prices for their homes; it just means that **we’re now in more of a balanced market.**
