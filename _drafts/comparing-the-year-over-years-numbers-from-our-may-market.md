Each week, we usually get together and recap our market’s performance from the week prior, but now that May has come and gone, I thought we’d take a final look at last month’s overall performance and discuss some of the trends worth noting.&nbsp;

**Let’s first focus our attention on closed sales, which reached 10,600 for the month of May.** That’s a slight dip from where we were this past April. Between May of 2018 and May of 2019, we saw a year-over-year decrease of about 6% or 7% in the number of homes that sold in our North Texas market. &nbsp;

**Our pending sales also saw a steep dropoff in May with just 8,600 units going under contract or exiting their option period**, compared to 11,300 in the same month a year earlier—a 20% drop year over year. &nbsp; &nbsp;

**As for the total number of listings, our market had 16,300 this May** versus 16,100 at the same time last year.

With closings and pending sales down and listings remaining relatively flat (at worst, modestly up), our inventory has arrived at a 12-month high in terms of inventory. **Across our whole market, there are more than 33,000 homes for sale right now,** which tops the peak our market hit last August. For comparison, we had a little over 28,000 homes on the market in May of last year.&nbsp;

We’ve been squarely in a seller’s market over the last few years, but our surplus of inventory is giving buyers more choices and, with greater momentum, we’re quickly moving toward a balanced market. &nbsp;

Remember: Anything less than six months’ worth of inventory is indicative of a seller’s market, and though **we’re currently at 3.6 months’ worth**, inventory levels are higher than they’ve been in about the last five years. All in all, now is a fantastic time for buyers to dive into the market.&nbsp;

If you’re a seller, bear in mind that more homes are sold in our North Texas market than at any other time of year. Don’t let the summer selling season to pass you by.&nbsp;

We talk a lot about North Texas’s market conditions on the whole, but real estate is hyperlocal, so you’ll want to have an expert in your particular area at your side.&nbsp;

If you have any questions or would just like to have a conversation about the state of the market, please get in touch with us. At BlueFuse, our goal is to make real estate awesome for you. We’ll talk to you soon\!&nbsp;
